# Linear Algebra Calculator
This is a simple linear algebra calculator that can calculate 
- rank of a matrix
- eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- matrix multiplication
    - multiply 2 matrices
    - evaluate a matrix expression
    - matrix power

# Installation
You can download the executable file from the release section.
- For windows download `linear_algebra_win.exe`
- The other one for linux.

## About the codebase
The code for the application is a single file `main.py`.
The other files are individual scripts for my practice.

- For numeric calculations I have used [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- For text decoration in the terminal I have used [rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) 
- For expression parsing used [sympy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html)
